<h2>My Top 5 Series of all Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>Amazing storyline and writing</p>
<h3>Succession</h3>
<p>Same as GOT with crazy actors</p>

<p>Really good writing as well. Viola Davis is a G.O.A.T</p>
<h3>Suits</h3>
<p>I love the characters and I could relate with them</p>

<p>It's a clean movie. No excessive sex and viiolence scenes</p>
